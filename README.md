OrderTracker
============

Project to highlight the differences between javascript frameworks Angular and Backbone.

Here's the plan:

1. We need to define a little more what the requirements are. Let's do that below.
1. I create an MVC project and some WebAPI controllers for REST interaction
1. I may also create static pages so we can highlight the difference between that and client-side code
1. .....
1. Profit!

## Ok, so, requirements?

- Display a list of orders, or line items, or something.
- Each line will have an item name, quantity, price each and line total
- Maybe there is a details view with more things? Not sure what was meant by this
- Then we will total up the lines at the bottom, apply tax and/or discounts
- Did we also want a list of orders / invoices? Is that what the master / detail thing was about?
